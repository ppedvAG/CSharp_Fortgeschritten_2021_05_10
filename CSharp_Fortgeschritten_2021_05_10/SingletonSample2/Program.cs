        //Let’s see what C# specification tells you:
        //The volatile keyword indicates that a field might be modified by
        //multiple threads that are executing at the same time. Fields that
        //are declared volatile are not subject to compiler optimizations that
        //assume access by a single thread. This ensures that the most up-todate value is present in the field at all times.
        //In simple terms, the volatile keyword can help you to provide
        //a serialize access mechanism. In other words, all threads will
        //observe the changes by any other thread as per their execution
        //order. You will also remember that the volatile keyword is
        //applicable for class (or struct) fields; you cannot apply it to local
        //variables.
